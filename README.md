## Building

In the project directory, run:

    npm install
    npm run build

This will compile the TypeScript sources and create a bundle script. Alternatively, you can also run

    npm install
    npm run watch

to start the Webpack watcher service, which will build the project as changes are made to files.

## Running

You can start a node server to serve the contents of the `client/public` directory by running

    npm start
